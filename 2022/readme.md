# Advent of Code 2022

Way too much time spend finding stupid bugs that could've easily been avoided ...

## Day 16 
I "cheated" the second star on day16 to see what the correct answer wwould be because i couldnt try my answers often enough. But i am very close :()

## Day17
The given input produces an empty line on the left and/or right of the chamber that throws of my results. Both test are working fine. Its only when the "empty" line appears that i get a wrong result.
I dont care enough to fix it anymore. Maybe later...
